===================================
Pseudo-Classes vs. Pseudo-Elements
===================================

Pseudo Classes:

- Target elements that match a certain criteria or state
- The name of the pseudo class is preceded by a single colon

:hover - target and style a link when it hovers that link
:first-child - list item that is first child of a parent element
:nth-child - allows to gets more specific
:not() - certain items that not needed specified criteria

Pseudo Elements:

- Generally target a certain part of an element
- The name of the pseudo class is preceded by two colons
(IE8 don't work very good with this ::) 

::before - allows to add and style content that cames before the rest os the content
::after
::first-letter
::first-line
::selection 

==================
What Comes Before
==================

For IE8 use only :

When we add a ::before he have to use the content: property. If we don't added it's not going to work fine.
Ex. 
h1::before {
content: ""
}

By default the content it's a inline content so we can style this.
